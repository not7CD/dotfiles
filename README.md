not7CD Dotfiles
===============

Provisioned dotfile setup, for now used for both laptop running linux mint and PC running fedora.
I might find it problematic, but I can minimize problems down the road by not adding distribution
specfic configs. I will try to incorporate i3-wm as my daily driver. I don't know if I want
to use urxvt due to it's high need for configuration and not working copy-paste functionality.
This will be reflected as my habits change.

Idea
----

I want minimal setup that can go with me wherever. I like integrity between setups I work on, laptop or PC, ubuntu or arch.
